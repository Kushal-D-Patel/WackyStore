# WackyStore
Designed a mock store queue simulator for the fictional, Wacky Store.
All customers in the Wacky Store are identified by a name.
Each customer entering the store has a cart, which contains a list of items, represented as a linked list.
All items in the wacky store are identified by an unique case-sensitive name.
At no point does any item in the cart have the same name as another in the same cart.
A customer's cart is always sorted by ASCII order.
Written in C.
